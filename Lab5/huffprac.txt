seasons change and I love when cold
feed the flame cause we can't let go
run away but we're running in circles
run away, run away, run away

Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked;
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Whereâ€™s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?
